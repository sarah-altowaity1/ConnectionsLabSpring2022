## Connected Web Application: Blob Opera

Experiment with Blob Opera: https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/blob-opera/AAHWrq360NcGbw?hl=en
\
Blob Opera is a web application that allows users to create their own opera-inspired song by dragging four colorful, blobby characters up, down, backwards, or forwards to produce different notes and vowels. The application has been developed as a machine learning experiment by David Lee in collaboration with Google Arts and Culture in which a neural network algorithm learned how to sing using audios from four opera singers.\

### What I liked about the application: 

From the landing page of the application, the user can tell that special attention has been given to the design of the website. Once the application is launched, a tutorial prompts the user to experiment with the blobs. No music background nor proficiency is required, although this tutorial introduces the user to the different pitches one can play by dragging the blob up or down (C#, G#, etc.), the different vowels blobs characters can sing by going backward or forward, and the different voices the blobs sing (bass, soprano, mezzo-soprano). In effect, the tutorial taught me, someone who knows nothing about pitch and musical voice, some music terminology in a very interactive and fun way. There is of course the option to skip the tutorial and jump right into creating your symphony. On the upper left, next to the “Blob Opera” sign, there is a question mark button which you can click at any time to learn more about how the application works which comes in handy if you skipped the tutorial by mistake. Advancing into creating your opera song, you find four blobs, any of which you can drag in any direction to start the song. What I was impressed with is the use of another machine learning model that allows the other blobs to harmonize with the blob you are dragging in real time, as you can only control one blob at any moment in time. Additionally, you can mute some blobs if you would like to avoid all the blobs singing together. Moreover, you can record your masterful creation and share via social media or e-mail. To match the allure of sending a recording to friends, you can change the background of the opera house the blobs are singing to different locations around the word, essentially taking them on a world tour. You also have the option to watch as the blobs perform a pre-recorded opera song from the musical folklore of that place, a feature which I think is wonderful for those who want to explore opera in different geographical contexts. The application also generates a link that could be shared on platforms that you cannot directly access via the options provided.\

### What I think could done differently:

Since controlling the blobs happens exclusively through the trackpad, wanting to move between muting blobs or switching from blob to blob could end up in awkwardly silent lapses in the symphony. Allowing some of the features to be distributed between the mouse and the keyboard would help minimize the issue and lead to a more seamless recording experience overall. I also would have loved to see more real time sharing options such as generating a link for an audience to join and watch as the opera is sung in real time or allowing collaborative singing between different users. Additionally, since recording is available, adding a cropping feature to dispose of mishaps would be nice as well as I would have loved to share one of the recordings I created if it were not for the couple of off-key notes toward the end.\
